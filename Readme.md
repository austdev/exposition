# Exposition

## Project Goals

Exposition is a modern HTML 5 photo gallery software for the Web. 

* **Maximize the use of the window** by dynamically adjusting the number of thumbnails of the size of pictures.
* **Easy deployment**. Rely on common web technologies. Apache with PHP and GD.
* **No Database**. No SQL. The filesystem is your database. An album is a directory. A photo an an image within.
* **No complex administration console** to upload and manage photos. Just upload files to the right place to add new photos.
* **Designed with modern browser in mind**. The absence of compatibility with IE 6 is a feature, not a bug.
